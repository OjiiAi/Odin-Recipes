   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>
        Seafood risotto is another seafood-and-rice dish we see Sanji serve a starving pirate Gin.
        Risotto is a tad more involved than fried rice, but if you’ve got the risotto rice (Arborio, or better yet, Carnaroli), 
        some broth, and the patience to follow the recipe, making a plate of creamy risotto isn’t going to be all to hard. 
        For Sanji’s seafood risotto, you’ll need small shrimps, octopus tentacles, and calamari rings, which I’d argue would take a 
        little more effort to cook the right way (have you ever had overcooked seafood? No easier way to ruin a dish!)
